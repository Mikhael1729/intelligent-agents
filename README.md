# Agents

The repository contains code to simplify the task of creating intelligent agents. The `Agent` class (`packages/agent/agent.py`) implements various informed search algorithms for such a task.

There are sample implementations of the `Agent` class that can be seen in `/examples/` directory. There are demos in `main.py` using those classes. You can see them by running the program (See the corresponding section.)
